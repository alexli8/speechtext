i want you to take a long hard look at the people you surround yourself with

you can't expect to become a millionaire when you're hanging out with drug

addicts you cannot expect to become the absolute

highest level version of yourself if you surround yourself with people that never

want to see you do better than them

wake the [ __ ] up the goals that you want to achieve in

your life are your goals and nobody else's

hundreds of people give up on their goals on a daily basis

and it's usually because they realized quickly after starting their journeys

that they're alone

nobody's waking them up in the morning nobody's pushing them when they start to

make excuses

and nobody's patting them on the back when they hit a milestone

so whatever you want to achieve in life maybe it's losing a certain amount of

weight to become the best version of yourself

maybe it's building a business to provide financial freedom for your

family and to travel the world or

maybe it's just being a better father mother or partner for your spouse

whatever it is it's all on you

and the quicker you realize that nobody's going to come and hold your

[ __ ] hand through life through this journey

the faster you will start to see success stop relying on outside sources of

inspiration motivation and support to and get you there

put your goddamn head down and take charge your [ __ ] life

and this is gonna mess with your head but sometimes this means you need to let

go of the people that you think are your closest friends

this means you might have to let go of the people that are the closest family

members to you you might have to let go of your mom

or your dad or your brothers or your sisters or that best friend you've had

since first grade they might not be bad people

but you need to understand that some people just aren't meant to be

in your life long term they're not meant to help you get to the

highest level of yourself

if every time you go to better yourself somebody hits you with a line like why

would you want to do that you need to find another social circle

you need to make a shift and surround yourself with people that challenge you

to grow you gotta surround yourself with lions

you gotta surround yourself with [ __ ] wolves

with people that are gonna push you to be the absolute best [ __ ] version of

yourself that people are gonna push you to your absolute [ __ ] breaking point

because you can only grow when you're uncomfortable

i don't know about you but i would much rather be

a unique [ __ ] wolf in a field full of sheep

then a sheep blending in with the others
