excellence [Music]

do you really believe that it's something that happens overnight

it can't be given to you no one is going to hand it to you

you have to sleep you have to breathe you have to eat it every single day of

your life [Applause]

until you achieve

that greatness

when we talk about excellence we are talking about

an obsession to outwork and outperform everybody in the room what is your

current standard on life or excellence or how

you pursue things how you operate basically when you show

up do you show up in an excellent way do you show up with an average way or do

you show up in a mediocre half-prepared half-thought-out way

listen to me very carefully excellence is about standard

and excellence is a requirement for your dream to come true

when others are sleeping you need to be awake

work on having an excellent driven mindset sure they're going to be

sometimes and you're going to just fall to the left and you may even fall to the

right you may even fall back

learn from your mistakes grow from your mistakes

and become unique but never quit [Music]

don't stop moving forward most people are totally okay with decent but i ain't

talking about most people i'm talking about you you want to be a

great one you want to be great let me break it down to you listen to me

are you only okay with excellence until excellence is the only option we

got something to work on until excellence is the only thing

you'll settle for we got work to do my friend

before you can be excellent you must first see what excellence looks like

i want you to make a conscious decision that from this day forward

excellence will be the description of everything you do

like high performance and high achievement is just who you have become

you may feel that because you're feeling so much you're so good and you're so

excellent at feeling but you're not realizing that you're growing

from your failures you're becoming more powerful

you are educating yourself you are realizing that your excellence is being

nourished it's going to get stronger you are

planning to see

average is not who you are okay is not who you are

[Music] decent that is not who you are

excellent is who you are nothing else will do

[Music] you gotta know your weaknesses

you gotta know your strengths

you gotta know your vulnerabilities be it in business

in relationships and time management and in investments it doesn't matter

self-awareness is one of the most paramount

distinctives that make up excellence if i'm not aware

i'm bankrupt what is your standard right now

if you're standing excellent what is it going to take for you to get there

a little bit more you got to agree that if you're not operating in an

excellent mindset it's going to require a little bit more

sometimes it ain't even a whole lot more sometimes you're close

just a little bit more to turn a c into a b just a little bit more to turn a b

into an a sometimes all it takes is just a little

bit more

none of us are perfect

it is something that seems to be so far away

it almost seems like it cannot be touched

but this is why we continue to work towards it

to work towards perfection to work towards being the best of

ourselves

you may feel that maybe you're so good at feeling

you don't even realize that the more you're feeling you're learning

[Music] excellence is taking full responsibility

for your future

in the game of life or whatever arena you are stepping into in whatever

industry that you are moving into the realm for

era is very very small i mean one half a

step too late or too early and you don't quite make it one half a

second too slow too fast and you don't quite catch it the inches

we need are everywhere around us they're in

every break every minute every second this is the

difference between losers and champions

you must drive for excellence sometimes you gotta bleed for excellence

sometimes you gotta cry for excellence and nobody

can do that for you kobe saw mike he saw what excellent looked like and he

knew what it took then he committed to excellence and

didn't let himself off the hook until he got it

you got to go and see what excellence looks like whatever you're pursuing

go and see what it looks like and go figure out what it takes to be excellent

[Music] it's not enough to just say how bad do

you want it okay go be excellent that's not enough

if you're like me you're pragmatic you need the how to

i need you to understand that this is not about doing

more than it is about becoming if you could become excellent

internally if you can master your psychology then everything you do is

excellent you can master character if you can master integrity if you could

master humility if you could stay hungry and humble

but it won't be easy you got to earn it don't get aggravated don't get emotional

put your mind in motion put your soul in motion

put your heart in motion and let your excellence flow through your veins

my football coach used to tell me how you do anything

is how you do everything and if you have selective excellence then there is a

malfunction in your character and integrity

can i ask you a question what do you hold back for why are you holding back

who are you hold back for you afraid to show somebody up

you want to be too big you don't nobody hating on you don't you ever play small

play big my friend don't you ever play small for nobody

play big and be the best you you can be

excellence is what will define our true purpose in this world

[Music]

you gotta see it my friend you gotta see it up close

whatever you pursuing whatever your dream is

i would encourage you just go and see it go and find it

go and look at it go and touch it go and smell it go and taste it do

whatever you got to do to make sure you see excellence don't

you settle for anything less [Music]

[Music]

[Music] [Applause]

[Music] you
